1.  instatiate virtual env and install requirements outlined in requirements.txt
        - flask, flask-cors, pyjwt should take care of everything

2.  Start server using 'python app.py' on your first run to instatiate databases, you can keep doing this or
    use 'flask run' if you set the app

3.  The local host will start at port 5000 and below is the requirement for each endpoint, keep in mind I didn't
    actually enforce any of these in the code so the request will just fail with a 500 if you mess it up

*** keep in mind spelling and capitalization are vital and every endpoint expects JSON

requires: username, password, first_name, last_name
optional: address, phone_number, email
('/student/create', methods=["POST"])

# requires: username, password
('/student/login', methods=["POST"])

# requires: student_id, class_id
('/student/addclass', methods=["POST"])

# requires: student id in route param
('/student/getclasses/<student_id>', methods=["GET"])

# optional: title, description
('/class/create', methods=["POST"])

('/class/getall', methods=["GET"])

# requires: class id route param
('/class/<class_id>', methods=["GET"])
